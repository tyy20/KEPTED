Description: Provides an implementation of a kernel-embedding of probability 
    test for elliptical distribution. This is an asymptotic test for elliptical 
    distribution under general alternatives, and the location and shape parameters 
    are assumed to be unknown. Some side-products are posted, including the 
    transformation between rectangular and polar coordinates and two 
    product-type kernel functions.

    distribution based on kernel embedding of probabilities.”
