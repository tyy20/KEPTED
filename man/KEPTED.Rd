\title{KEPTED: Kernel-Embedding-of-Probability Test for Elliptical Distribution}
\description{
Provides an implementation of a kernel-embedding of probability test for
elliptical distribution. This is an asymptotic test for elliptical
distribution under general alternatives, and the location and shape
parameters are assumed to be unknown. Some side-products are posted,
including the transformation between rectangular and polar coordinates and
two product-type kernel functions.
